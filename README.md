## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-sum.git
  ```

## Algorithm
The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Initialize a hashtable to store the count of each character.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, increment its count in the hashtable.
4. Find the character with the maximum count in the hashtable.
5. Return the character with the maximum count as the result.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
1. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
2. Use the algorithm by calling the `MaxOccurrence` function with your array and target as arguments.
